ReVision is configured for a particular modeling language by a set of consistency-preserving edit operations.The edit operations for Ecore can be [browsed here](https://repairvision.github.io/_pages/editrules/ecore.html). The editing operations were generated by a set of patterns specified for each consistency rule.

* The edit operations are grouped by their context, the pattern from which they were derived, and the corresponding consistency-rule(s).
* A consistency-rule is annotated with &lt;&lt;constraint&gt;&gt;.
* A consistency-preserving edit operation is annotated with &lt;&lt;rule&gt;&gt;.
* Select a pattern or an edit operation to view the graph or transformation rule.
* _Note:_ The (edge) labels can be moved by Drag'n'Drop.
