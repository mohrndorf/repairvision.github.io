<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Models in Model-Drive nEngineering are heavily edited in all stages
of software development and can become temporarily inconsistent.
In general, there are many alternatives to fix an inconsistency, the
actual choice is left to the discretion of the developer. Model repair
tools should support developers by proposing a short list of repair
alternatives. Such recommendations will be only accepted in prac-
tice if the generated proposals are plausible and understandable.
Current approaches, which mostly focus on fully automatic, non-
interactive model repairs, fail in meeting these requirements. This
paper proposes a new approach to generate repair proposals which
is based on the assumption that inconsistencies are introduced by
incomplete editing processes which can be located in the version
history of a model. Such an incomplete editing process is either 
undone or it is extended to a full execution of a consistency-preserving
edit operation. We showcase the usage and benefits of our repair
tool ReVision using a simplified multi-view UML model of a video
on demand system.
